# Orbit Mail — Developer Guide

Technical documentation for building, configuring, and contributing to Orbit Mail. For end-user installation and usage, see [README.md](README.md).

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 20 or later
- **Linux** desktop (developed on Linux Mint Cinnamon; other desktops supported)
- **Build tools** — needed for the `better-sqlite3` native module (`build-essential`, Python 3, etc.)
- **OAuth credentials** — required for Gmail and Microsoft 365 during development (see [OAuth setup](#oauth-setup))

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> orbit-mail
cd orbit-mail
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OAuth client IDs (for Gmail/O365)
npm run dev
```

If Electron fails to start because `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` is set in your shell:

```bash
unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE
npm run dev
```

### Dev app menu launcher

Generates a `.desktop` file that runs `npm run dev` from the project directory:

```bash
npm run icons
npm run install:desktop
```

If the launcher icon is missing, run `npm run icons` before `npm run install:desktop`.

## OAuth setup

OAuth client IDs are loaded from a `.env` file at dev/build time. End users of packaged builds need registered app credentials until in-app OAuth configuration is added (see [Known limitations](#known-limitations)).

**Bring-your-own-credentials.** Orbit Mail does **not** ship with bundled Google/Microsoft credentials. Established open-source clients — Thunderbird (Mozilla), and Evolution/Geary via GNOME Online Accounts — each register one OAuth client, take it through full verification, and embed it so sign-in "just works" for every user. That approach carries a recurring verification and security-assessment burden (see [Full verification & CASA](#full-verification--casa-public-distribution-only)) that only an org can realistically sustain. Instead, each person running Orbit Mail (or building their own copy) registers their **own** OAuth app and drops the client ID into `.env`. The cost of that model is the one-time setup below, plus an "unverified app" click-through per account — in exchange for zero verification cost and no user cap beyond Google's unverified 100.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Google (Gmail)

1. Open [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project and enable the **Gmail API**
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen (**External**)
4. Create credentials → **Desktop app**
5. Add the `https://mail.google.com/` scope to the consent screen (this is the only scope that grants IMAP/SMTP access, and Google classes it as **restricted**)
6. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into `.env`:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

**Gmail notes**

- IMAP must be enabled in each Gmail account's settings.

**Who can sign in (publishing status)**

The code accepts any Gmail account; what limits sign-in is your OAuth app's publishing status:

| Status | Who can sign in | Caveats |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Testing** | Only Google accounts on the **test users** allowlist (max 100) | Refresh tokens **expire after 7 days**, so accounts must re-auth weekly |
| **In production**, unverified | **Any** Gmail account | Users see an "unverified app" warning to click through; hard cap of **100 total users**; refresh tokens no longer expire at 7 days |
| **In production**, verified | **Any** Gmail account | No warnings, no user cap; requires brand verification + an annual **CASA security assessment** for the restricted scope (weeks to complete) |

To let **any** Gmail account sign in: OAuth consent screen → **Audience** → **Publish app**. Each new user clicks **Advanced → Go to Orbit Mail (unsafe)** past the unverified-app screen until you complete full restricted-scope verification (only needed for wide public distribution).

#### Full verification & CASA (public distribution only)

You only need this to **remove the unverified-app warning and exceed 100 users** — i.e. to distribute Orbit Mail so anyone can install it and sign in without registering their own credentials. For personal use or a small group, the unverified-production path above costs nothing; skip this section.

Because `https://mail.google.com/` is a **restricted** scope (the strictest tier), full verification is two layers:

1. **OAuth app verification** (brand + app review) — *free*, but requires a domain you own and have verified, a public homepage and **privacy policy** hosted on it, per-scope justifications, and a YouTube demo of the consent flow. Google reviews manually; expect days to weeks.
2. **CASA** (Cloud Application Security Assessment) — an **annual, paid** security assessment by a Google-authorized third-party assessor (via the App Defense Alliance), plus ongoing compliance with Google's **Limited Use** policy (no ads, restricted human review, no data resale). Cost is assessor- and complexity-dependent — roughly **low single-thousands up to ~$15k USD per year** — and it **recurs every year**. A remediation round adds cost if the assessment finds gaps.

There is no lighter Gmail scope that avoids this — the narrower Gmail API scopes (`gmail.modify`, `gmail.readonly`, …) are *also* restricted, so a full mail client can't design its way around CASA.

**How the big OSS clients absorb it:** Thunderbird (Mozilla/MZLA) and Evolution/Geary (GNOME) each maintain one verified client and complete the assessment at the org level, so individual users never see a warning. A solo/indie project can't realistically sustain a recurring four-to-five-figure annual assessment for a free app — which is exactly why Orbit Mail uses bring-your-own-credentials instead.

Figures are ballpark and the program changes over time; get current quotes from ADA-authorized assessors before budgeting. Microsoft's platform has **no equivalent** restricted-scope assessment for the IMAP/SMTP flow used here.

### Microsoft (Office 365 / Outlook)

1. Open [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://portal.azure.com/) → **App registrations** → **New registration**
2. Set **Supported account types** to match the accounts you'll sign in with (e.g. _Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts_ for both work and outlook.com)
3. Under **Authentication** → **Add a platform** → **Mobile and desktop applications**
4. Add the loopback redirect URI **exactly**: `http://127.0.0.1/callback`
   - Entra ignores the port for loopback URIs, so this single entry covers the random port Orbit Mail listens on. The host (`127.0.0.1`) and path (`/callback`) must match.
5. Under **Authentication** → **Advanced settings**, set **Allow public client flows** to **Yes** (required for the desktop sign-in + refresh-token flow)
6. Copy the **Application (client) ID** into `.env`:

```env
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=your-microsoft-client-id
MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID=common
```

**Microsoft notes**

- **You do not need to add API permissions in the portal.** Orbit Mail requests the IMAP/SMTP scopes (`IMAP.AccessAsUser.All`, `SMTP.Send`, `offline_access`) dynamically at sign-in, and you consent in the browser. This is why "Office 365 Exchange Online" not appearing under **API permissions → APIs my organization uses** does not matter for this flow.
- That API only appears for tenants with an active Exchange Online license; for personal Microsoft accounts it is absent by design. If your tenant admin requires _pre-consent_, you can add it by searching the GUID `00000002-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000`, but it is optional here.
- Your tenant administrator must allow OAuth-based IMAP/SMTP (some tenants disable IMAP/SMTP entirely).
- `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID=common` works for most cases; use your specific tenant GUID to restrict sign-in to one organization.

## AI (optional)

The AI features — per-message **Analyze** and the folder **Tasks** sweep — are off unless the user supplies an Anthropic API key. Unlike the OAuth credentials above, this key is **not** read from `.env`: it's entered in-app (✦ toolbar button → AI settings), encrypted with Electron `safeStorage`, and stored in the `app_preferences` table under `ai_api_key`. So there is nothing to configure at build time for AI.

`electron/services/ai-service.ts` uses `@anthropic-ai/sdk` with model `claude-opus-4-8` and structured output. Message content is sent to Anthropic only when the user triggers a feature. On **Analyze**, the user can opt to include a message's attachments for extra context (text extracted inline; images and PDFs sent as native content blocks) — the UI prompts first because attachments increase token usage.

**Caching.** Per-message analysis is cached on the `messages` row (`ai_analysis` / `ai_analysis_at`). The Tasks sweep is also incremental:

- The sweep scans **unread** mail by default or **all** messages in the folder (`SweepScope`, chosen in the dialog).
- Each message's extracted tasks are cached on its own row (`sweep_cache` = JSON `{ task, priority }[]`, `sweep_cache_at`). A NULL cache means "never analysed"; an empty array means "analysed, produced no tasks". A sweep only sends messages whose cache is NULL, so re-sweeping an unchanged folder makes **no** API call — the result reports `freshCount: 0`. The cache is a partial column so ordinary sync/flag updates in `upsertMessage` leave it intact, and it cascade-deletes with the message.
- Sweep results are persisted per folder in the `sweep_tasks` table (composite PK `(folder_id, id)`, where `id` is a stable dedupe key of source message + normalised task text). `open` rows are the outstanding tasks and are replaced on each sweep; `completed` rows are the user's ticked-off history (pruned after 30 days). Completed tasks are fed back into the prompt ("do NOT list these again") and filtered client-side so they never resurface. Per-folder sweep metadata (last run time, count, scope) lives in `app_preferences` under `ai_sweep_meta`.
- Opening the Tasks dialog calls `ai:getTasks` (a pure DB read, no tokens); `ai:sweep` runs a fresh incremental sweep; `ai:completeTask` / `ai:reopenTask` toggle a task's status. `ai:exportTasks` writes the current list to a Markdown file — the renderer builds the Markdown (`src/utils/taskExport.ts`) and main handles the save dialog + file write.

### Sync model

- **Initial sync** — up to 200 messages per folder (UID-sorted batch)
- **Incremental sync** — UID-based delta fetch; only new UIDs since `highestSyncedUid`
- **Background poll** — POP3 every 20s; IDLE-capable IMAP accounts every 90s (IDLE already push-syncs their inboxes), plus one immediate catch-up sync shortly after launch. Accounts sync in parallel.
- **IMAP IDLE** — inbox folders on supported accounts for near-realtime delivery, including live flag changes and expunge (deletion) pushes
- **Server-side reconciliation** — sync detects messages expunged on the server and removes them from the local cache; flag changes propagate in both directions (`imap-idle.ts`, `imap-sync.ts`)
- **Connection pool** — one reused IMAP client per account (`imap-pool.ts`) with a
  per-account operation mutex and 30s idle-close, so a batch of server ops shares a
  single connection instead of reconnecting each time. Kept separate from the IDLE
  monitor's persistent client.
- **Batched writes** — each folder's fetched messages upsert in one transaction
- **Unread counts** — recalculated from local message read state after fetch (kept in sync with the message list)

### Threading

- Each message stores `in_reply_to`, `references`, and a derived `thread_id`
  (`thread-util.ts`: `References[0]` root → `In-Reply-To` → own Message-ID →
  normalized-subject fallback). Grouping is always scoped by `(account_id,
  thread_id)`.
- The list shows one row per thread in the current folder (`listThreads`, window
  functions); opening a thread pulls the **whole conversation across folders**
  (`getThread`), so received + Sent messages interleave in the reader.
- Search results stay flat (single-message reader); a one-message thread renders
  like an ordinary message.

### Search

- **Local search** — scope-aware substring `LIKE` over the cached `messages` table
  (`searchMessages` in `db-service.ts`). The scope (`SearchField`) selects the
  columns matched: `all` (From/To/Subject/Snippet/Body), `from`, `to`, `subject`,
  or `body`. The chosen scope is persisted in `UiPreferences`.
- **Server-side fallback** — when local search returns nothing (or on the explicit
  *Search whole mailbox* action), `searchServerMessages` (`imap-sync.ts`) runs a
  live IMAP search — Gmail `X-GM-RAW` over *All Mail*, or `from`/`to`/`subject`/`body`
  SEARCH keys over the INBOX for plain IMAP — imports the matches into the DB so they
  open like any cached message, and returns them. This reaches mail outside the local
  sync window. POP3 has no server-side search.
- The FTS5 index (`messages_fts`) is still built on sync but is **not** currently used
  by the query path; scoped substring search is used instead because it also covers
  From/To, which the FTS index does not store.

### Performance notes

- **Optimistic UI** — read/star/flag/move/delete update the list (and open reader)
  immediately and roll back on IPC failure; the reader header paints from the list
  summary while the body loads. See `patchMessageInList` in `mailStore.ts`.
- **Virtualized list** — the message list renders through `virtua`'s `VList` with a
  memoized row, so DOM node count stays roughly constant regardless of folder size.
- **Reference-preserving refresh** — `mergeMessageList` reuses unchanged row objects
  on background refresh, so memoized rows skip re-render and the list doesn't flicker.
- **DB** — WAL + tuned pragmas; `COUNT(*)` for counts; list queries project just the
  summary columns (no body blobs); partial index on unread rows.

## Integration tests (GreenMail)

`npm run build` is still the main verification gate, and there is no unit-test
framework. The one exception is the sync layer, where the failure modes are
protocol-level and expensive to get wrong (silent TLS downgrade, push that
stops arriving, a cache wipe that loses mail). Those are covered by an
integration suite that runs against a real mail server.

```bash
npm run test:imap           # start GreenMail, run the suite, tear it down
npm run test:imap -- --keep # leave the container up for poking at afterwards
```

**Requires Docker.** The runner (`scripts/imap-integration.mjs`) starts
[GreenMail](https://greenmail-mail-test.github.io/greenmail/) as
`orbit-mail-greenmail-test` (IMAP 3143, IMAPS 3993, SMTP 3025), builds the
suite with esbuild, and runs it inside a **windowless Electron main process** —
the DB layer needs `app.getPath()`, and `better-sqlite3` is compiled against
Electron's ABI, so plain `node` cannot host it. `userData` is redirected to a
temp directory, so the suite never touches your real mail database.

`scripts/imap-integration.suite.ts` imports the app's own services rather than
reimplementing them, so it exercises the shipping code paths:

| Area | What it asserts |
|------|-----------------|
| TLS | `'starttls'` requires the upgrade and *refuses* a server that does not offer it — GreenMail's plain port advertises no STARTTLS, so it is an accurate stand-in. Includes a guard proving the old mapping would have logged in over plaintext. |
| Sync | Seeded messages reach the local cache with correct subjects; a repeat sync is a no-op. |
| UIDVALIDITY | After a validity reset the cache is *rebuilt to its previous size*, not truncated to one batch, with no duplicate rows. |
| IDLE | Push works, survives a full server restart, and resumes afterwards. |
| Responsiveness | A mark-read issued while a flag reconcile is in flight is not stuck behind the whole pass — `imap-pool` serializes per account, so anything holding the lane across every folder blocks user actions. |
| Send | SMTP submission succeeds; the message is filed in `Sent` exactly once, shares its Message-ID with the delivered copy, and does not carry `Bcc` in its headers. |

Notes for anyone extending it:

- A first-ever sync of a folder only caches the newest `SYNC_BATCH_SIZE` (200)
  messages — that is the app's initial-sync depth, not a bug. To build a cache
  larger than one batch, sync, append newer mail, and sync again.
- The UIDVALIDITY reset is triggered by writing a bogus stored validity rather
  than by recreating the mailbox, so the trigger does not depend on how
  GreenMail allocates validity numbers.
- GreenMail is in-memory: a restart empties every mailbox but keeps the user.
- A check reported as `todo` documents a known-open bug and does not fail the
  run, so the suite can describe reality without going red. There are none at
  present; use `todo()` rather than deleting a check when you find a bug you are
  not fixing yet.
- The suite exits non-zero on any failure, so it is CI-ready, but nothing runs
  it automatically yet.

## Building & packaging

Regenerate icons before building distributables:

```bash
npm run icons
```

### Build from source

```bash
npm run build
```

Output goes to `out/` (main, preload, and renderer bundles).

### Linux packages

```bash
npm run dist          # .deb + AppImage
npm run dist:deb      # .deb only
npm run dist:appimage # AppImage only
```

Install the Debian package:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i release/Orbit\ Mail-*.deb
```

Packaged builds install a `.desktop` launcher with `StartupWMClass=orbit-mail` for correct taskbar/window grouping on Cinnamon and other desktops. `mailto:` handling is opt-in so the app does not hijack links from browsers or admin consoles.

OAuth credentials from `.env` are embedded at build time via electron-vite environment loading — rebuild after changing `.env`.

## Troubleshooting (development)

**Account add fails (Google)**  
Confirm IMAP is enabled, the consent screen includes `https://mail.google.com/`, and your account is a test user if the app is in Testing mode.

**Account add fails (Microsoft)**  
Register the redirect URI exactly as `http://127.0.0.1/callback`, set **Allow public client flows** to **Yes**, and confirm your tenant allows OAuth IMAP/SMTP. You do **not** need to add "Office 365 Exchange Online" API permissions — scopes are consented in the browser at sign-in. If you see "no refresh token", re-check that public client flows are enabled and try again.

**`better-sqlite3` compile errors on install**  
Install build essentials: `sudo apt install build-essential python3`.

**Electron won't start (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`)**  
Run `unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` before `npm run dev`.

**Unread badge ahead of message list**  
Folder unread counts are updated after messages are persisted during sync. If you see a mismatch, check for stale renderer refresh timing in `src/stores/mailStore.ts` and `syncFolder` in `electron/services/imap-sync.ts`.

## Known limitations

See [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) for the full backlog. Critical item for distribution:

- **End-user OAuth** — packaged users cannot sign in without developer-supplied client IDs in `.env` at build time; no in-app OAuth settings yet
