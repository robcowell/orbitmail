# Orbit Mail — Deferred Work

Items intentionally deferred. Tackle these before calling Orbit Mail production-ready for non-developers.

## Shipped since the initial pass

- **Delete to Trash** via `Delete` / `Backspace`, with provider-correct trash resolution (SPECIAL-USE `\Trash`), optimistic list removal, and a destination-named toast.
- **Unread-count badge** on the taskbar / launcher and in the window title.
- **Optional AI** (bring-your-own Anthropic key): per-message **Analyze** (summary, action items, questions, key context) and an inbox **Tasks** sweep (choice of **Unread** (default) or **All messages**). Sweep results and ticked-off tasks are persisted per folder; completed tasks are fed back to the model so they don't resurface. The task list can be exported to a Markdown file on demand.
- **Rich compose editor** — extended formatting toolbar (headings, bold/italic/underline/strikethrough, alignment, colour, lists, links, quote, inline code, clear), HTML send, collapsible quoted text on replies/forwards with an attribution line and separator, and a drag-and-drop attachment UI showing type icons and sizes.
- **Conversation threading** — messages group by RFC 5322 headers (`thread_id` derived from `References`/`In-Reply-To`, subject fallback) into one collapsed row per conversation; opening a thread loads the full **account-wide** conversation across folders (Sent replies interleaved) in a stacked, collapsible reader. Includes AI **reply drafts** with tone options (Brief/Neutral/Detailed).
- **Performance & perceived-speed pass (phases 1–3)** — tuned SQLite pragmas + `COUNT(*)` + summary-column projection + partial unread index + batched sync writes; optimistic read/star/flag/move/delete with rollback and an instant-painting reader; `virtua`-virtualized message list with memoized rows and reference-preserving refresh; folder-switch skeletons; a pooled per-account IMAP client with a per-account op mutex; parallel account sync; cached Sent path; send does a Sent-only sync; attachments fetch just their BODYSTRUCTURE part.
- **Bring-your-own-credentials** setup documented (README → "Run your own copy"; DEVELOPERS.md → OAuth setup + verification/CASA notes).
- **Search upgrades** — scoped search (**All/From/To/Subject/Body**, persisted in `UiPreferences`) that now also matches sender/recipient (previously subject/snippet/body only); a one-click clear button; and a live **server-side (IMAP) fallback** that searches the whole mailbox when the local cache has no match (or on demand via *Search whole mailbox*), importing matches so they open like any cached message. POP3 has no server-side search.
- **Sync reconciliation** — server-side deletions (EXPUNGE) are reconciled into the local cache, and flag/expunge changes are pushed over IMAP IDLE.
- **AI attachments in Analyze** — per-message **Analyze** can optionally include a message's attachments for extra context (opt-in prompt, since it costs more tokens).
- **Quality-of-life fixes** — dark-mode attachment-chip contrast, search clear button, and an attachment paperclip on message-list rows.
- **Attachment save-as** — per-attachment **Save** and **Save all** actions, plus a right-click *Save attachment* context menu, with a download path picker.
- **Manual reply** — a primary, non-AI **Reply** action in the reader (opens the composer with quoted text); the AI reply-draft is demoted to a secondary action.
- **Reply All** — replies to the sender plus all other To/Cc recipients (self and the original sender de-duplicated), exposed as a visible button in the single-message and thread reader headers and the toolbar, alongside the existing right-click context-menu entry.

## Critical

### End-user OAuth distribution
- Google/Microsoft client IDs still require a developer `.env` at build/dev time.
- **Impact:** `.deb` / AppImage users cannot sign in without credentials of their own. Since #44 they no longer have to clone and rebuild — a package carries whatever the build machine's `.env` held, and anyone can drop their own into `~/.config/orbit-mail/.env`. What is still missing is a *zero-config* option, and an in-app screen so it does not require editing a file.
- **Fix:** Ship registered public OAuth app IDs (needs verification + CASA for the restricted Gmail scope — see DEVELOPERS.md), or add an in-app settings screen for OAuth client configuration.

## Security & correctness audit (2026-07-21)

Full-codebase audit of the desktop app (Android port excluded). Findings are ranked by severity; file:line references were current at commit `0967177`. Everything below is **unfixed** unless marked.

> Security-relevant entries are stated as what to change and where, without reproduction detail, since this repo is public and these are open items.

**Fixed in #29 (renderer isolation):** untrusted email HTML could reach navigation sinks and `style`-based overlays that DOMPurify's defaults permit, and the `mailto:` body reached the compose editor's `innerHTML` unescaped. Three layers added: an expanded shared sanitizer (`src/utils/sanitizeEmailHtml.ts`), `will-navigate` blocking on both windows, and a renderer CSP.

**Fixed in #30 (IMAP sync):** the three High-severity sync defects — STARTTLS enforcement, the IDLE reconnect deadlock, and the UIDVALIDITY cache wipe. Struck through below.

Remaining items still reference the audit-time line numbers, which have shifted in `electron/services/imap-sync.ts`, `imap-idle.ts`, `smtp-send.ts` and `account-credentials.ts` since those two merges.

### High

- ~~**STARTTLS is not enforced on IMAP or SMTP-OAuth.**~~ **Fixed** (#30) — `imapConnectionSecurity()` replaces `imapFlowSecure()` and maps `'starttls'` to `{ secure: false, doSTARTTLS: true }`, making the upgrade mandatory; `createOAuthTransport` now sets `requireTLS: true`. Note the behaviour change: an account configured as STARTTLS against a server that does not offer it now fails to connect instead of silently continuing unencrypted.
- ~~**IDLE never reconnects — push mail dies silently.**~~ **Fixed** (#30) — the runtime entry is kept until the reconnect timer fires, so `scheduleIdleReconnect` can find it. Reconnects now actually happen, so they back off exponentially (5s → 5 min cap, reset on a successful connect).
- ~~**Sent mail never filed for manual IMAP accounts.**~~ **Fixed** (#32) — the MIME message is now built up front with `MailComposer` and that exact buffer is both submitted and appended to `Sent`, so the filed copy shares the delivered copy's Message-ID. The append is scoped to `provider === 'imap'`; Gmail files SMTP-submitted mail itself and would otherwise end up with two copies. Two loose ends it leaves behind:
  - **O365 Sent filing is unverified.** Exchange Online does not reliably file SMTP-submitted mail into Sent Items (it is governed by `MessageCopyForSMTPClientSubmissionEnabled`), so O365 accounts may have the same gap. It was left out of the fix rather than guessed at — needs testing against a real tenant.
  - **The filed copy does not record Bcc.** Bcc is deliberately kept out of the message headers (it belongs in the SMTP envelope), so the copy in `Sent` does not show who was blind-copied. Most clients keep Bcc in their Sent copy; matching that means a second build with `keepBcc` and a pinned Message-ID.
- ~~**UIDVALIDITY change destroys the local cache.**~~ **Fixed** (#30) — the restore set is resolved from the server rather than filtered against stale local UIDs (which silently dropped every colliding message), sized to what was cached and refilled in batches. `uidValidity` is only written after a successful refill, so an interrupted resync retries.
- **POP3 has no socket timeout, and one stall wedges all sync.** `pop3ClientOptions` never sets `timeout`, which node-pop3 requires to arm its socket timer. A stalled `RETR` leaves the promise pending forever with `syncStatus.syncing` stuck true, and every later poll and manual refresh short-circuits on `if (syncStatus.syncing) return`.
- ~~**FTS index deletes are a permanent no-op.**~~ **Fixed by removal** (#36) — `messages_fts` was contentless, so `DELETE ... WHERE message_id = ?` could never match (a contentless FTS5 table reads every column back as NULL) and it accumulated a duplicate row per re-index. Nothing ever queried it: there was no `MATCH` anywhere in the codebase, and `searchMessages` has always used `LIKE`. It was dropped rather than repaired — indexing cost ~0.5ms per synced message and ~8MB for a write-only structure. Search behaviour is unchanged (verified: identical result hashes before and after).
  - **If full-text search is wanted later**, rebuild it as an *external-content* FTS5 table over `messages` (`content='messages'`, joined on the implicit `rowid`), maintained by triggers. That stores no duplicate text and makes deletes work. Note it would change matching semantics: FTS matches whole tokens, so searching `mail` would stop matching `gmail`, which today's substring `LIKE` does. Preserving that needs prefix or trigram tokenisation.
  - This also leaves the separate finding below (search full-scans `body_html` with `LIKE`) unaddressed — measured at 60ms on a 3.3k-message profile.
- ~~**`listThreads`/`countThreads` scan the whole account per render.**~~ **Partly fixed** (#35) — two expression indexes on `COALESCE(thread_id, id)` cut `listThreads` 57.7ms → 35.4ms and `countThreads` 3.9ms → 1.0ms on a real 3.3k-message profile (cold-cache raw query 119ms → 39ms), for ~0.9MB of index. Query rewrites were measured and rejected: a materialized CTE was a wash and a CTE join was worse.
  - **Still linear in account size.** The remaining ~35ms is computing `MAX(date)` per thread across the account and sorting every thread before `LIMIT/OFFSET` — the indexes make that cheaper, not sub-linear, so a 100k-message account will still be slow. Fixing it properly means denormalising the thread key and last-activity date (a `thread_key` column, or a per-thread aggregate table maintained on upsert/delete), which trades drift risk for an index-ordered page query.
  - `countThreads` is now effectively free, so only the list query is worth further work.

### Medium

- ~~**OAuth flows need PKCE and `state` validation.**~~ **Fixed** (#37) — both flows now send a PKCE challenge (S256) and a per-attempt random `state`, which the loopback listener checks before accepting a code. A mismatched callback is answered and ignored rather than treated as an error, so a hostile page cannot abort a real sign-in by racing it. The listener also has a 5-minute timeout and closes on every path, including an abandoned or failed attempt. Covered by the integration suite.
- **Credential storage falls back to base64** when `safeStorage.isEncryptionAvailable()` is false (`account-credentials.ts:36`, `ai-service.ts:62`) — a normal state on Linux without a keyring. Surface it in the UI, or refuse to store.
- ~~**`attachments:open` hands the file straight to the OS opener**~~ **Fixed** (#42) — opening an attachment whose extension can execute (`.desktop`, `.sh`, `.run`, `.jar`, `.exe`, and the rest) now shows a warning naming the real extension, defaulting to Cancel. A `.pdf.exe` reads as a PDF in the list; the prompt says otherwise.
- **`shell:openExternal` does not validate the scheme** (`main.ts:806`). Restrict `new URL(url).protocol` to http/https/mailto in the main handler rather than trusting the renderer.
- **STARTTLS autoconfig misparsed as implicit SSL.** `mail-autoconfig.ts:38` tests `includes('tls')` first and `'starttls'.includes('tls')` is true, so the `starttls` branch is unreachable for the literal string. Autodetected 143/587 accounts get stored as `ssl` and hang on a TLS handshake against a plaintext port.
- **No index on `attachments.message_id`** (`db/index.ts:91-98`). Full scan on every email open, and with `ON DELETE CASCADE` on an unindexed child key, one full scan *per deleted parent row* — pruning 5,000 messages does 5,000 scans.
- **`migrateFtsIndex` loads every body into one array** (`search-index.ts:83-87`). `.all()` over `body_text`+`body_html` is ~320MB of JS strings at startup before any window exists; OOMs on large mailboxes, and the success flag is written afterwards so it crash-loops. Use `.iterate()`.
- **Unbounded attachment buffering during sync** (`imap-sync.ts:497,539-564`) — 200 parsed messages retain their attachment `Buffer`s until the batch write (~2GB for a folder averaging 10MB attachments). The buffers are never used: only filename/type/size are stored.
- ~~**Packaged builds can't do OAuth.**~~ **Fixed** (#44) — the build now substitutes the credentials into the main bundle (`define` in `electron.vite.config.ts`), and the runtime resolves environment → `~/.config/orbit-mail/.env` → baked, in that order. A package built with a `.env` present works; one built without prints which keys were missing and can be configured at runtime instead. Credentials stay out of the preload and renderer bundles.
- **Unguarded DDL in `migrateSchema`** (`db/index.ts:163`) — the `UNIQUE` index on `(folder_id, uid)` postdates the MVP, which had no such constraint; a pre-existing duplicate throws out of startup with no in-app recovery, on every launch.
- **POP3 UID is a 32-bit hash** (`pop3-sync.ts:41-48`, duplicated in `attachment-fetch.ts:191`) — ~1% collision chance at 10k messages. A collision silently skips a new message, or makes `DELE` delete the *wrong* message from the server.
- **Out-of-window POP3 messages re-download forever** (`pop3-sync.ts:91-101`) — the UID-skip check runs before the window check and windowed-out messages are never stored, so up to 200 full `RETR`+parse cycles run every 20s.
- **mbox export is lossy** (`folder-actions.ts:120-137`) — no `>From ` quoting (silently splits messages in every reader), whole folder materialized twice in memory, `toString('utf8')` corrupts 8-bit content.
- **DB never reclaims space** — `auto_vacuum=0` and no `VACUUM` anywhere; 148MB of a 331MB test DB was freelist.
- **Local search full-scans the account with `LIKE` over `body_html`** on the main process, with a renderer-supplied `limit` that is never clamped (`db-service.ts:1736-1759`).
- **On-disk permissions are left at defaults.** Raw `.eml` exports are written to `/tmp` and never cleaned up (`imap-sync.ts:1372`); the DB file is 0644 and the data/attachments dirs 0775, relying on Electron having created `~/.config/orbit-mail` as 0700. Set explicit modes (`0o700` dirs, `0o600` DB incl. `-wal`/`-shm`) and clean up temp exports.
- **Remote content loads unconditionally** — no block-remote-images preference anywhere, so opening an email confirms the read and reveals the client's IP to the sender (`img src`, `background`, `style="background:url(…)"`).
- **AI prompt handling trusts message content** — bodies are interpolated straight into the prompt with no fencing or distrust framing (`ai-service.ts:287-296`, `:437-439`), and drafts derived from them are offered to the user to send. `isFromUser` also matches with `fromLower.includes(email)`, so a display name can flip the analysis polarity.

### Low

- ~~**Linux launcher badge never cleared.**~~ **Fixed** (#41) — the Unity `LauncherEntry` signal was emitted on a percent-encoded object path that D-Bus rejects outright, and the failure was swallowed as "this desktop ignores Unity signals", so a badge once set could never be cleared. `app.setDesktopName` was also stripping the `.desktop` suffix Electron documents as required, leaving `setBadgeCount` pointing at a non-existent entry. In-app counts were always correct; only the launcher was stale.


- Optimistic star/read/flag never rolls back in threaded view (the default), because `patchMessageInList` returns `null` when the row exists only in `selectedMessage` (`mailStore.ts:287-320`).
- `selectThread` has no error handling — a failed fetch pins "Loading conversation…" forever and rejects into a `void` call (`mailStore.ts:535-563`); milder in `selectMessage:1165`.
- Thread mutations (`deleteThread`, `archiveThread`, `moveThreadToFolder`) test a pre-`await` state snapshot, so the reader can keep showing a deleted conversation.
- Compose sends the original message's **unsanitized** HTML in the quote block (`ComposeWindow.tsx:131-133`), carrying the sender's trackers into replies and the Sent folder.
- Bulk delete/prune paths are non-transactional and re-count folder unread per row; attachment files are unlinked before their DB rows.
- ~~Attachments sharing a filename overwrite each other on disk.~~ **Fixed** (#42) — the cache path is keyed by attachment id, and files are written 0600. The audit only spotted the on-disk half: an end-to-end test then showed *both* rows also resolved to the same MIME part, so the second attachment's content was never fetched at all. Attachments are identified by `(filename, size)`, but BODYSTRUCTURE reports encoded octets while the stored size is mailparser's decoded length, so the size rarely matches and both fell back to "first part with this name". Now disambiguated by position, which is how the rows are created.
- Accounts dedupe by email alone (`db-service.ts:38-41`), so adding a manual account overwrites an existing OAuth one in place.
- Renderer-supplied `attachmentPaths` are `readFileSync`'d with no allowlist (`smtp-send.ts:125-130`); the main process should track dialog-approved paths instead of trusting the renderer.
- `buildLikePattern` leaves `_` as a live LIKE wildcard (`search-index.ts:36-40`); `SEARCH_FIELD_COLUMNS[field]` resolves `'constructor'` via the prototype and throws (`db-service.ts:1746`).
- Pooled IMAP client replaced without closing the old socket when `usable === false` (`imap-pool.ts:95-98`). ~~Flag reconciliation holds the account's connection lane across every folder.~~ **Fixed** (#34) — `reconcileAccountFlags` now borrows the pooled client per folder, so an interactive op waits for one folder rather than the whole pass. Observed in a dev run as `[ipc-slow] messages:markRead 6288ms`; the integration suite reproduces it at 2995ms vs 312ms fixed.
- **Interactive IMAP ops still pay a cold reconnect.** `IDLE_CLOSE_MS` is 30s (`imap-pool.ts:16`), so a click after half a minute of inactivity waits for TCP + TLS + authentication, and an OAuth token refresh on Gmail. Raising it trades one longer-lived connection per account (Gmail allows 15; the app uses 2) for interactive latency. Measure before tuning.
- **`markRead`/`toggleStar` await the server round-trip inside the IPC handler** (`main.ts` `messages:markRead` et al). The renderer patches optimistically so the delay is not visible, but the handler stays open for the whole round-trip and a burst of actions serializes. Decoupling means a background queue plus a way to roll the UI back after the fact.
- The global `uncaughtException` handler logs and continues in an undefined state (`main.ts:114`); `void reconcileAllAccountsFlags(...)` at `imap-sync.ts:884` is the one `void` call site missing a `.catch()`.
- `folder-actions.ts:73` annotates a return type `Account` that is never imported (esbuild strips it, so `npm run build` passes).
- Preferences: every UI change rewrites the whole `app_state` blob including the sender lists (`preferences-service.ts:75-81`), and `getAppState()` returns the cached object by reference; `before-quit` flushes via a fire-and-forget `executeJavaScript`, so the last change can be lost.

### Checked and clean

No `rejectUnauthorized: false` anywhere. No SQL injection (every dynamic fragment is placeholder generation; no dynamic column/table names). No SMTP header injection (nodemailer strips CR/LF — verified directly). No attachment path traversal. No schema drift between `schema.ts`, `CREATE TABLE`, and `migrateSchema`. AI cache columns correctly survive sync upserts. The print path is sound: escaped interpolation, sanitized body, hidden window with `javascript: false`, `sandbox: true`, no preload. Renderer listener/interval cleanup is correct throughout.

## AI follow-ups

- Thread / conversation-level analysis (currently single-message and folder-level sweep only).
- ~~Reply-draft suggestions from a message.~~ **Shipped** — tone-steered (Brief/Neutral/Detailed) AI reply drafts grounded in the conversation, opened in the composer.
- Model / effort / provider selection in AI settings (currently hardcoded to Claude Opus 4.8, Anthropic-only).
- Message-count / cost preview before an inbox sweep. (Sweeps are now **incremental**: each message's extracted tasks are cached on its row, so a Sweep only sends messages it has never analyzed — a re-sweep of an unchanged inbox spends zero tokens. Reopening the Tasks dialog reads persisted results with no call. A one-time full pass over new mail is still billed.)
- Optional **force re-analysis** for the sweep — the per-message cache assumes a message's tasks never change (true for immutable IMAP bodies), so there is currently no way to re-run the model on already-analysed mail (e.g. after tuning the prompt). `sweepTasks` is one boolean away from supporting it.

## Performance backlog (phase 4)

**Shipped (quick wins):**
- Startup reorder — register IPC + show the window first, then defer background IMAP network (IDLE + polling) until after first paint, with an immediate catch-up sync on launch.
- Bundle slimming — deep per-icon Phosphor imports (ssr variants) and a vendor/react-vendor `manualChunks` split so app-code updates don't invalidate vendor chunks.
- IDLE-aware poll — POP3 polls every 20s; IDLE-capable IMAP accounts poll every 90s (IDLE push-syncs their inboxes).
- Hoisted the hot FTS index statements (run per message during sync) to module scope.

**Still deferred:**
- Move sync + `better-sqlite3` + `simpleParser` off the main process (utility process / worker thread) — the largest jank/memory win, and the riskiest change.
- V8 code cache for the renderer bundle (fragile to wire in Electron; the vendor split already helps cache reuse).
- Window bounds still live in the DB, so window creation opens the DB (migration is cheap post-first-run, so not decoupled).

## Post-MVP (logged for later)

- Local draft autosave + IMAP draft upload
- Thread-level context menu (archive/move whole conversation) and multi-thread select — currently threads support open, per-message actions, and whole-thread delete (Delete key)
- Compose signatures and inline/pasted images (rich HTML editor now shipped)
- Editable / trimmable quoted text (currently the collapsed quote is read-only and always included on send)
- Inline search-operator syntax (`from:`, `subject:`) and result highlighting — field **scoping** now ships via the search-scope selector (All/From/To/Subject/Body); inline operator parsing and match highlighting are still deferred
- Auto-update, code signing, CI, integration tests
- Cross-platform builds (Windows/macOS)
- POP3 move support or reduced POP3 scope
